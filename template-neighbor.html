    <p>Dear <?= substitutions.neighborName ?>,</p>
    <p>Welcome to Adopt a Neighbor Ashland! Thank you for signing up and doing your part by staying home during this global emergency.</p>
    <p>
    We are working to match you with a neighbor who will help you with groceries and errands. In the meantime, you can help the community by reaching out to friends and family who might be socially isolated during this time. Phone calls, video calls, and emails are all great ways to stay connected! If you have a garden, consider planting an extra row for your neighbors or the food bank.
    </p>
    <p>It is also important to take good care of yourself by keeping up healthy patterns of eating, sleeping, and exercise. Fresh air is a great thing, so go outside often if you are able, just remember to keep up with the social distancing guidelines (6 feet) when out for a walk.</p>
    <p>Take care and be safe,</p>
    <p>Cathy, Tonya, Chuck, Blaire, Mica, and Dylan</p>
  </body>
